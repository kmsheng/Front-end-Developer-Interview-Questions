# Can you explain the difference between coding a web site to be responsive versus using a mobile-first strategy ?
Using a mobile-first strategy will reduce lots of css code.

In my experience starting to write css with a desktop resolution and trying to change it to be responsive have two problems
 - CSS file size is larger
 - Some components are not able to be displayed in mobile version
