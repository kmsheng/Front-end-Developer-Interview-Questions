# Describe how you would create a simple slideshow page.
There are two approaches to do this. 

One is to use JavaScript to control image's `display` property or `transform` property.

The other one is to use pure CSS with html `input` tags to create a slider. Pure CSS slider has better performance but worse maintainability ( need to add inputs and css rules based on number of slides).
