# Explain the difference between layout, painting and compositing.

 - `layout` - Browser canculates how much space of each element should take and where to put
 - `painting` - Browser fills in pixels. For example, text, background, border and color.
 - `compositing` - Web elements can be made as many layers, compositing means to arrange the right order of them.
