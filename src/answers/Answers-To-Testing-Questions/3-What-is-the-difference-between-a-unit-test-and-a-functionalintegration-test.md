# What is the difference between a unit test and a functional / integration test?

## Unit Test
 - Only test individual functions alone and isolated.
 - Without browser, network and database.

## Functional Test / E2E
 - To test against functional requirements.
 - For web applications, there are some tools to launch the browser and click automatically.

## Integration Test
Testing involves more than one component and how they function together.
